Arduino sensors for disaster response project
Description:
Aziz is an all-in-one, comprehensive monitoring system that integrates various metrics to assess signs of human life from beneath rubble. First, our sensing technology contains a sensitive voice detection system to identify voices originating from under the rubble that may be difficult for the human ear to hear. Moreover, our system contains a carbon dioxide monitor, of which elevated levels measured through ppm-range changes in atmospheric CO2 composition indicate respiration. Our platform also integrates an altitude sensor for gauging the depth of potential victims with respect to sea level to a high degree of accuracy. Finally, our system harnesses user-controlled ultrasonic sensors that scan across areas and provides real-time information on the 3D landscape of a rescue workerâ€™s surroundings, even in complete darkness. Ultimately, these four capabilities work in complement with one another to support rescue teams as they try to identify signs of life amongst difficult terrain and in dangerous environments.
